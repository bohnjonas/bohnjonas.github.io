abstract: "This work explores sensor fusion for object detection in challenging light conditions using
the flexx2 3D camera. The focus is on integrating infrared and depth data to enhance
object detection performance on resource-constrained and low-power devices, particularly
in robotics and autonomous systems where efficiency and accuracy in object detection
are crucial under varied environmental conditions. As part of this work, a novel dataset
for object detection combining infrared and depth data is introduced, employing the
Faster Objects, More Objects (FOMO) model for sensor fusion. The thesis showcases
the feasibility of using sensor fusion and FOMO for fast and low-power object detection
on constrained devices."

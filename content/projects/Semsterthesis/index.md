summary: "This work was done as part of my Semester Project at the Center for Project-Based Learning, where I developed a novel approach to improve object detection on rescource constrained devices in low-light conditions.
Grade: 5.75 / 6.0"

abstract: "This thesis explores the challenges of object detection in low-light conditions and proposes a novel approach to improve performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a standard benchmark dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results in challenging scenarios."

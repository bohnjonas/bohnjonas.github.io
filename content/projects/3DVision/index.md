summary: "This work was part of the 3D Vision course at ETH Zurich held by Prof. Dr. Marc Polleyfeys. We propose employing a monocular pose-estimation algorithm to obtain an initial guess of the spatial relationship, that can serve as a good prior for subsequent multi-agent posegraph optimisation."

abstract: "In a human-robot interaction scenario, it is crucial for the different agents to be able to precisely localize each other in the shared environment, i.e. to visualize a planned trajectory. However, feature-based visual registration is an arduous task because feature matching between different camera streams is computationally expensive and challenging due to different points-of-view. In this work, we propose employing a monocular pose-estimation algorithm to obtain an initial guess of the spatial relationship, that can serve as a good prior for subsequent multi-agent posegraph optimisation."
